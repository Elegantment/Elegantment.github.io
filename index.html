hello  
====Food Values====
[[Carnivores]] will only eat meat, while [[herbivores]] will only eat berries. During the baby phase, you have to hand feed the baby until it reaches the juvenile stage. This can take quite a long time so be prepared and have time to sit around feeding a baby. Also, food value does not seem to affect the baby anymore, it's a certain time stamp for how long the baby will grow into a juvenile as of 4-18-2016.
